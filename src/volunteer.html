            goal is to create an inviting and fitting environment of worship, a place that is suited for sacred celebrations,
            that is dignified and beautiful. The ministry strives to provide an ambiance of tranquility and beauty that prepares
            the human heart to receive God’s word so the parishioners can enter more fully into communion with God and focus on
            the liturgy and prayer.

        <h2>Councils</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>Finance</h3>
        <p>The Finance Council is parallel to the Pastoral Council and assists the Pastor with the management of parish funds.
            Using the Parish Pastoral Plan as a guide, they do long-range financial planning to help insure that funds needed
            to achieve the goals are available. They work with the parish ministry leaders to help them create budgets that
            reflect the goals for their particular ministries. If funds need to be raised, they oversee any development efforts
            in the parish. They monitor the spending of the funds and provide the Pastoral Council with information needed for
            their assessment and evaluation responsibilities. Thus, the Finance Council Representative attends Pastoral Council
            meetings in order to keep the line of communication open between the Finance Council and the Pastoral Council, to be
            a link to the Finance Council about deliberations that have financial implications with the ultimate goal that the
            Finance Council and the Pastoral Council work in synchrony.</p>

        <h3>Pastoral</h3>

            parish on issues of Liturgy & Prayer, Faith Formation, Outreach & Care, and Stewardship in relation to the
            overall mission/vision of the parish.</p>

        <h3>Stewardship</h3>
        <p>The Finance Council (FC) is parallel to the Council and assists the Pastor with the management of parish funds.
            Using the Parish Pastoral Plan as a guide, they do long-range financial planning to help insure that funds needed
            to achieve the goals are available. They work with the parish ministry leaders to help them create budgets that
            reflect the goals for their particular ministries. If funds need to be raised, they oversee any development
            efforts in the parish. They monitor the spending of the funds and  provide the Council with information needed
            for their assessment and evaluation responsibilities. Thus, the FC Representative attends Pastoral Council
            meetings in order to keep the line of communication open between the FC and the Council, to be a link to
            the FC to keep them informed about deliberations that have financial implications with the ultimate goal that
            FC and the Council work in synchrony.</p>
